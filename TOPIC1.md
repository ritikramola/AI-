# GENERATIVE AI

Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates new content — text, images, video, code, and other formats — by using models trained on very large datasets. These models (often called language models) learn statistical and semantic relationships between elements of data, enabling them to produce coherent and meaningful outputs.

- **Definition:** Generates new content rather than only analyzing or classifying existing data.
- **Mechanism:** Trained on large corpora, models encode how words and concepts relate, which guides content generation.
- **Why it works:** The model's internal representations capture semantic relationships, allowing it to assemble plausible sequences (e.g., fluent text or realistic images).
- **Model sizes:** Large language models (LLMs) use many parameters and lots of data, generalize broadly, and are more capable but costlier; small language models (SLMs) are smaller, less expensive, and often more efficient for domain-specific tasks.


### Generative AI scenarios

Common uses of generative AI include:

Implementing chatbots and AI agents that assist human users.
Creating new documents or other content (often as a starting point for further iterative development)
Automated translation of text between languages.
Summarizing or explaining complex documents.

## Computer Vision

Key points to understand about computer vision include:

**Computer vision** is accomplished by using large numbers of images to train a model.

 -> Image classification is a form of computer vision in which a model is trained with images that are labeled with the main subject of the image (in other words, what it's an image of) so that it can analyze unlabeled images and predict the most appropriate label - identifying the subject of the image.

 -> Object detection is a form of computer vision in which the model is trained to identify the location of specific objects in an image.

There are more advanced forms of computer vision - for example, semantic segmentation is an advanced form of object detection where, rather than indicate an object's location by drawing a box around it, the model can identify the individual pixels in the image that belong to a particular object.
You can combine computer vision and language models to create a multi-modal model that combines computer vision and generative AI capabilities.

### Computer vision scenarios

#### Common uses of computer vision include:

Auto-captioning or tag-generation for photographs.
Visual search.
Monitoring stock levels or identifying items for checkout in retail scenarios.
Security video monitoring.
Authentication through facial recognition.
Robotics and self-driving vehicles.


## Speech

### Key points to understand about speech include:

- Speech recognition is the ability of AI to "hear" and interpret speech. Usually this capability takes the form of speech-to-text (where the audio signal for the speech is transcribed into text).

- Speech synthesis is the ability of AI to vocalize words as spoken language. Usually this capability takes the form of text-to-speech in which information in text format is converted into an audible signal.

- AI speech technology is evolving rapidly to handle challenges like ignoring background noise, detecting interruptions, and generating increasingly expressive and human-like voices.

### AI speech scenarios

#### Common uses of AI speech technologies include:

Personal AI assistants in phones, computers, or household devices with which you interact by talking.
Automated transcription of calls or meetings.
Automating audio descriptions of video or text.
Automated speech translation between languages.

## Natural Language Processing

Key points to understand about natural language processing (NLP) include:

- NLP capabilities are based on models that are trained to do particular types of text analysis.

- While many natural language processing scenarios are handled by generative AI models today, there are many common text analytics use cases where simpler NLP language models can be more cost-effective.

#### Common NLP tasks include:

1. Entity extraction - identifying mentions of entities like people, places, organizations in a document

2. Text classification - assigning document to a specific category.

3. Sentiment analysis - determining whether a body of text is positive, negative, or neutral and inferring opinions.

4. Language detection - identifying the language in which text is written.

### Natural language processing scenarios
Common uses of NLP technologies include:

- Analyzing document or transcripts of calls and meetings to determine key subjects and identify specific mentions of people, places, organizations, products, or other entities.

- Analyzing social media posts, product reviews, or articles to evaluate sentiment and opinion.

- Implementing chatbots that can answer frequently asked questions or orchestrate predictable conversational dialogs that don't require the complexity of generative AI.
