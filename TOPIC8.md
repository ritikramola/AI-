# Introduction to AI speech concepts

Speech is one of the most natural ways humans communicate, and bringing speech capabilities to AI applications creates more intuitive, accessible, and engaging user experiences. Whether you're building a voice assistant, creating accessible applications, or developing conversational AI agents, understanding speech technologies is essential for modern AI solutions.

In this module, you'll explore the two fundamental speech capabilities that power voice-enabled applications: speech recognition (converting spoken words to text) and speech synthesis (converting text to natural-sounding speech). You'll discover how these technologies work together to create seamless voice interactions and learn about the real-world scenarios where speech can transform user experiences.

## Speech-enabled solutions
Speech capabilities transform how users interact with AI applications and agents. Speech recognition converts spoken words into text, while speech synthesis generates natural-sounding audio from text. Together, these technologies enable hands-free operation, improve accessibility, and create more natural conversational experiences.

Integrating speech into your AI solutions helps you:

- Expand accessibility: Serve users with visual impairments or mobility challenges.
- Increase productivity: Enable multitasking by removing the need for keyboards and screens.
- Enhance user experience: Create natural conversations that feel more human and engaging.
- Reach global audiences: Support multiple languages and regional dialects.

### Common speech recognition scenarios
Speech recognition, also called speech-to-text, listens to audio input and transcribes it into written text. This capability powers a wide range of business and consumer applications.

### Customer service and support
Service centers use speech recognition to:

- Transcribe customer calls in real time for agent reference and quality assurance.
- Route callers to the right department based on what they say.
- Analyze call sentiment and identify common customer issues.

- Personalize audio content based on user preferences.
**Business value**: Lowers production costs, enables rapid prototyping, and creates customized experiences at scale.

## Combining speech recognition and synthesis
The most powerful speech-enabled applications combine both capabilities to create conversational experiences:

**Voice-driven customer service**: Agents listen to customer questions (recognition), process the request, and respond with helpful answers (synthesis).
**Interactive voice response (IVR) systems**: Callers speak their needs, and the system guides them through options using natural dialogue.
**Language learning applications**: Students speak practice phrases (recognition), and the system provides feedback and corrections (synthesis).
**Voice-controlled vehicles**: Drivers give commands hands-free (recognition), and the system confirms actions and provides updates (synthesis).
These combined scenarios create fluid, two-way conversations that feel natural and reduce the friction users experience with traditional interfaces.

## Key considerations before implementing speech
Before you add speech capabilities to your application, evaluate these factors:

- **Audio quality requirements**: Background noise, microphone quality, and network bandwidth affect speech recognition accuracy.
- **Language and dialect support**: Verify that your target languages and regional variations are supported.
- **Privacy and compliance**: Understand how audio data is processed, stored, and protected to meet regulatory requirements.
- **Latency expectations**: Real-time conversations require low-latency processing, while batch transcription can tolerate delays.
- **Accessibility standards**: Ensure your speech implementation meets WCAG guidelines and doesn't create barriers for some users.

## Speech recognition

Speech recognition, also called speech-to-text, enables applications to convert spoken language into written text. The journey from sound wave to text involves six coordinated stages: capturing audio, preparing features, modeling acoustic patterns, applying language rules, decoding the most likely words, and refining the final output.

### Audio capture: Convert analog audio to digital
Speech recognition begins when a microphone converts sound waves into a digital signal. The system samples the analog audio thousands of times per second—typically 16,000 samples per second (16 kHz) for speech applications—and stores each measurement as a numeric value.

### Pre-processing: Extract meaningful features
Raw audio samples contain too much information for efficient pattern recognition. Pre-processing transforms the waveform into a compact representation that highlights speech characteristics while discarding irrelevant details like absolute volume.

### Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
MFCC is the most common feature extraction technique in speech recognition. It mimics how the human ear perceives sound by emphasizing frequencies where speech energy concentrates and compressing less important ranges.

#### How MFCC works:
1. Divide audio into frames: Split the signal into overlapping 20–30 millisecond windows.
2. Apply Fourier transform: Convert each frame from time domain to frequency domain, revealing which pitches are present.
3. Map to Mel scale: Adjust frequency bins to match human hearing sensitivity—we distinguish low pitches better than high ones.
4. Extract coefficients: Compute a small set of numbers (often 13 coefficients) that summarize the spectral shape of each frame.

The result is a sequence of feature vectors—one per frame—that captures what the audio sounds like without storing every sample. These vectors become the input for acoustic modeling.

### Acoustic modeling: Recognize phonemes
Acoustic models learn the relationship between audio features and phonemes—the smallest units of sound that distinguish words. English uses about 44 phonemes; for example, the word "cat" comprises three phonemes: /k/, /æ/, and /t/.

#### From features to phonemes
Modern acoustic models use transformer architectures, a type of deep learning network that excels at sequence tasks. The transformer processes the MFCC feature vectors and predicts which phoneme is most likely at each moment in time.

Transformer models achieve effective phoneme prediction through:

- **Attention mechanism**: The model examines surrounding frames to resolve ambiguity. For example, the phoneme /t/ sounds different at the start of "top" versus the end of "bat."
- **Parallel processing**: Unlike older recurrent models, transformers analyze multiple frames simultaneously, improving speed and accuracy.
- **Contextualized predictions**: The network learns that certain phoneme sequences occur frequently in natural speech.
The output of acoustic modeling is a probability distribution over phonemes for each audio frame. For instance, frame 42 might show 80% confidence for /æ/, 15% for /ɛ/, and 5% for other phonemes.

### Language modeling: Predict word sequences
Phoneme predictions alone don't guarantee accurate transcription. The acoustic model might confuse "their" and "there" because they share identical phonemes. Language models resolve ambiguity by applying knowledge of vocabulary, grammar, and common word patterns. Some ways in which the model guides word sequence prediction include:

1. Statistical patterns: The model knows "The weather is nice" appears more often in training data than "The whether is nice."
2. Context awareness: After hearing "I need to," the model expects verbs like "go" or "finish," not nouns like "table."
3. Domain adaptation: Custom language models trained on medical or legal terminology improve accuracy for specialized scenarios.


### Decoding: Select the best text hypothesis
Decoding algorithms search through millions of possible word sequences to find the transcription that best matches both acoustic and language model predictions. This stage balances two competing goals: staying faithful to the audio signal while producing readable, grammatically correct text.

#### Beam search decoding:
The most common technique, beam search, maintains a shortlist (the "beam") of top-scoring partial transcriptions as it processes each audio frame. At every step, it extends each hypothesis with the next most likely word, prunes low-scoring paths, and keeps only the best candidates.

For a three-second utterance, the decoder might evaluate thousands of hypotheses before selecting "Please send the report by Friday" over alternatives like "Please sent the report buy Friday."

 **Caution**

Decoding is computationally intensive. Real-time applications balance accuracy and latency by limiting beam width and hypothesis depth.

### Post-processing: Refine the output
The decoder produces raw text that often requires cleanup before presentation. Post-processing applies formatting rules and corrections to improve readability and accuracy.

#### Common post-processing tasks:
- Capitalization: Convert "hello my name is sam" to "Hello my name is Sam."
- Punctuation restoration: Add periods, commas, and question marks based on prosody and grammar.
- Number formatting: Change "one thousand twenty three" to "1,023."
- Profanity filtering: Mask or remove inappropriate words when required by policy.
- Inverse text normalization: Convert spoken forms like "three p m" to "3 PM."
- Confidence scoring: Flag low-confidence words for human review in critical applications like medical transcription.
Azure Speech returns the final transcription along with metadata like word-level timestamps and confidence scores, enabling your application to highlight uncertain segments or trigger fallback behaviors.

### How the pipeline works together
Each stage builds on the previous one:

- Audio capture provides the raw signal.
- Pre-processing extracts MFCC features that highlight speech patterns.
- Acoustic modeling predicts phoneme probabilities using transformer networks.
- Language modeling applies vocabulary and grammar knowledge.
- Decoding searches for the best word sequence.
- Post-processing formats the text for human readers.

By separating concerns, modern speech recognition systems achieve high accuracy across languages, accents, and acoustic conditions. When transcription quality falls short, you can often trace the issue to one stage—poor audio capture, insufficient language model training, or overly aggressive post-processing—and adjust accordingly

### Speech synthesis

Speech synthesis—also called text-to-speech (TTS)—converts written text into spoken audio. You encounter speech synthesis when virtual assistants read notifications, navigation apps announce directions, or accessibility tools help users consume written content audibly.

Speech synthesis systems process text through four distinct stages. Each stage transforms the input incrementally, building toward a final audio waveform that sounds natural and intelligible.

#### Text normalization: Standardize the text
Text normalization prepares raw text for pronunciation by expanding abbreviations, numbers, and symbols into spoken forms.

Consider the sentence: "*Dr. Smith ordered 3 items for $25.50 on 12/15/2023."*

A normalization system converts it to: "Doctor Smith ordered three items for twenty-five dollars and fifty cents on December fifteenth, two thousand twenty-three."

Common normalization tasks include:

- Expanding abbreviations ("Dr." becomes "Doctor", "Inc." becomes "Incorporated")
- Converting numbers to words ("3" becomes "three", "25.50" becomes "twenty-five point five zero")
- Handling dates and times ("12/15/2023" becomes "December fifteenth, two thousand twenty-three")
- Processing symbols and special characters ("$" becomes "dollars", "@" becomes "at")
- Resolving homographs based on context ("read" as present tense versus past tense)
- Text normalization prevents the system from attempting to pronounce raw symbols or digits, which would produce unnatural or incomprehensible output.

### Linguistic analysis: Map text to phonemes
Linguistic analysis breaks normalized text into phonemes (the smallest units of sound) and determines how to pronounce each word. The linguistic analysis stage:

- Segments text into words and syllables.
- Looks up word pronunciations in lexicons (pronunciation dictionaries).
- Applies G2P rules or neural models to handle unknown words.
- Marks syllable boundaries and identifies stressed syllables.
- Determines phonetic context for adjacent sounds.

### Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion
Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion maps written letters (graphemes) to pronunciation sounds (phonemes). English spelling doesn't reliably indicate pronunciation, so G2P systems use both rules and learned patterns.

For example:

- The word "though" converts to /θoʊ/
- The word "through" converts to /θruː/
- The word "cough" converts to /kɔːf/

- Each word contains the letters "ough", but the pronunciation differs dramatically.

Modern G2P systems use neural networks trained on pronunciation dictionaries. These models learn patterns between spelling and sound, handling uncommon words, proper names, and regional variations more gracefully than rule-based systems.

When determining phonemes, linguistic analysis often uses a transformer model to help consider context. For example, the word "read" is pronounced differently in "I read books" (present tense: /riːd/) versus "I read that book yesterday" (past tense: /rɛd/).

### Prosody generation: Determine pronunciation
Prosody refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns that make speech sound natural. Prosody generation determines how to say words, not just which sounds to produce.

#### Elements of prosody
Prosody encompasses several vocal characteristics:

- Pitch contours: Rising or falling pitch patterns that signal questions versus statements
- Duration: How long to hold each sound, creating emphasis or natural rhythm
- Intensity: Volume variations that highlight important words
- Pauses: Breaks between phrases or sentences that aid comprehension
- Stress patterns: Which syllables receive emphasis within words and sentences

Prosody has a significant effect on how spoken text is interpreted. For example, consider how the following sentence changes meaning depending on which syllable or word is emphasized:

- "I never said he ate the cake."
- "I never said he ate the cake."
- "I never said he ate the cake."
- "I never said he ate the cake."

#### Transformer-based prosody prediction
Modern speech synthesis systems use transformer neural networks to predict prosody. Transformers excel at understanding context across entire sentences, not just adjacent words.

##### The prosody generation process:
- **Input encoding**: The transformer receives the phoneme sequence with linguistic features (punctuation, part of speech, sentence structure)
- **Contextual analysis**: Self-attention mechanisms identify relationships between words (for example, which noun a pronoun references, where sentence boundaries fall)
- **Prosody prediction**: The model outputs predicted values for pitch, duration, and energy at each phoneme
- **Style factors**: The system considers speaking style (neutral, expressive, conversational) and speaker characteristics

Transformers predict prosody by learning from thousands of hours of recorded speech paired with transcripts. The model discovers patterns: questions rise in pitch at the end, commas signal brief pauses, emphasized words lengthen slightly, and sentence-final words often drop in pitch.

##### Factors influencing prosody choices:
- **Syntax**: Clause boundaries indicate where to pause
- **Semantics**: Important concepts receive emphasis
- **Discourse context**: Contrasting information or answers to questions may carry extra stress
- **Speaker identity**: Each voice has characteristic pitch range and speaking rate
- **Emotional tone**: Excitement, concern, or neutrality shape prosodic patterns
- **The prosody predictions create a target specification**: "Produce the phoneme /æ/ at 180 Hz for 80 milliseconds with moderate intensity, then pause for 200 milliseconds."

#### Speech synthesis: Generate audio
Speech synthesis generates the final audio waveform based on the phoneme sequence and prosody specifications.

##### Waveform generation approaches
Modern systems use neural vocoders—deep learning models that generate audio samples directly. Popular vocoder architectures include WaveNet, WaveGlow, and HiFi-GAN.

**The synthesis process**:
1. Acoustic feature generation: An acoustic model (often a transformer) converts phonemes and prosody targets into mel-spectrograms—visual representations of sound frequencies over time
2. Vocoding: The neural vocoder converts mel-spectrograms into raw audio waveforms (sequences of amplitude values at 16,000-48,000 samples per second)
3. Post-processing: The system applies filtering, normalization, or audio effects to match target output specifications

The vocoder essentially performs the inverse of what automatic speech recognition does—while speech recognition converts audio into text, the vocoder converts linguistic representations into audio.

#### The complete pipeline in action
When you request speech synthesis for "Dr. Chen's appointment is at 3:00 PM":

- Text normalization expands it to "Doctor Chen's appointment is at three o'clock P M"
- Linguistic analysis converts it to phonemes: /ˈdɑktər ˈtʃɛnz əˈpɔɪntmənt ɪz æt θri əˈklɑk pi ɛm/
- Prosody generation predicts pitch rising slightly on "appointment", a pause after "is", and emphasis on "three"
- Speech synthesis generates an audio waveform matching those specifications

The entire process typically completes in under one second on modern hardware.
